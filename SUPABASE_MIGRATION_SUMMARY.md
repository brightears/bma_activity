# Supabase Migration Summary

## What's Been Done

I've set up your BMA Activity Report system to work with Supabase (free tier) and Vercel (free hosting). Here's what I've created:

### 1. Database Schema (`supabase-schema.sql`)
- Complete PostgreSQL schema optimized for Supabase
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-user access
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Support for International (USD) and Thailand (THB) regions

### 2. API Endpoints (`/api` directory)
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/login.js`, `/api/auth/signup.js`
- **Reports**: `/api/reports/index.js`, `/api/reports/[id].js`, `/api/reports/submit.js`
- All endpoints use Supabase Auth for security
- Serverless functions ready for Vercel deployment

### 3. React Integration
- `SupabaseAuth.jsx`: Authentication context with hooks
- `App-supabase.jsx`: Updated app with protected routes
- `ReportForm-supabase.jsx`: Form component using Supabase

### 4. Configuration Files
- `package.json`: Updated with Supabase dependencies
- `vercel.json`: Deployment configuration
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables

## Quick Start

1. **Set up Supabase** (5 minutes)
   - Create account at supabase.com
   - Create new project
   - Run `supabase-schema.sql` in SQL editor
   - Copy API keys

2. **Deploy to Vercel** (10 minutes)
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Import to Vercel
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy!

3. **Invite Your Team**
   - Add users in Supabase dashboard
   - They'll get invite emails
   - Everyone can create/edit their own reports

## Key Benefits

✅ **Free Forever** - Both Supabase and Vercel have generous free tiers
✅ **Multi-User** - Each person has their own reports
✅ **Secure** - Row Level Security ensures data privacy
✅ **Real-time Ready** - Can add live updates later
✅ **Scalable** - Can grow with your needs
